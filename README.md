<h2><a class="anchor" id="purpose"></a>Overview</h2>

Adventure Work is a leading bike selling company specializing in bikes, accessories, and clothing. In the initial years, the sales were booming. 
However, after two to three years, a concerning trend was observed — the return rate of bikes and other products started to increase significantly.
To address this challenge, the higher management decided to hire a Business Analyst. The analyst's primary role is to analyze the sales and return data to generate data-driven insights and recommendations.
